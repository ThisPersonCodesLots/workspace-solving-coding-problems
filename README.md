# Workspace for Solving Coding Problems

This repo contains my solutions to various coding problems from different sources, such as LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc. I use Python as my main programming language, and I try to write clean and efficient code. I also include some comments and explanations for each solution, as well as the time and space complexity analysis.

The purpose of this repo is to practice and improve my problem-solving skills, as well as to learn new algorithms and data structures. I hope that this repo can also be useful for anyone who is interested in solving coding problems or preparing for coding interviews.

## How to Use This Repo

You can clone this repo to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/vioo-bkp/workspace-solving-coding-problems.git
```

Then you can navigate to the folder of the problem you want to check out, and run the solution file using Python. For example, to run the solution for the LeetCode problem "Two Sum", you can do:

```bash
cd leetcode/easy
python 1470.Shuffle the Array.py
```

You can also modify the solution files or add your own solutions to the repo. Feel free to fork this repo and make pull requests if you have any suggestions or improvements.

## Resources

Here are some of the sources that I use to find coding problems:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): A platform for practicing and learning coding skills, with a large collection of problems and a supportive community.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): A website that offers challenges and contests in various domains of computer science, such as algorithms, data structures, databases, etc.
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/): A competitive programming website that hosts regular contests and provides a rating system for participants.
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/): Challenge yourself on small coding exercises called "kata". Each kata is crafted by the community to help you strengthen different coding techniques.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): A series of challenging mathematical and computational problems that require more than just brute force to solve.
